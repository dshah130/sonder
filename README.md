# sonder-1
Welcome to Sonder, our turn based game
=================================================================================


npm i to install package dependencies

then run "npm run start-client" the client side rendering of the my game which connects to my created real time mutliplayer server

it was created using google clouds, firebase storage, and databaes
and also uses pixi.js library to render js images and sprites in the dom

in this implementation of the game it was done throught typescipt which was different from the proposed method of delivery but was approved by Professor Katchabaw

The hard part of this was implementing a real time multiplayer server and syncing it to both serve sites and handle game running in the front end
